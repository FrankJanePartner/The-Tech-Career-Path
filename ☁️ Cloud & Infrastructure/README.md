# ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure

## Overview
Cloud & Infrastructure encompasses the design, deployment, management, and optimization of cloud-based systems and underlying infrastructure. This field focuses on scalable, reliable, and secure computing environments that support modern applications and services. Professionals in this area work with cloud platforms, networking, databases, and systems to ensure high availability, performance, and cost-efficiency.

## Common Roles
- Cloud Engineer
- Infrastructure Engineer
- Systems Administrator
- Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
- DevOps Engineer
- Network Engineer
- Database Administrator

## Required Skills
- Proficiency in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Knowledge of networking concepts (TCP/IP, DNS, firewalls)
- Experience with containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Scripting and automation (Python, Bash, Terraform)
- Monitoring and logging tools (Prometheus, ELK stack)
- Security best practices (IAM, encryption)
- Database management (SQL, NoSQL)
- Linux/Unix system administration

## Career Roadmap
1. **Entry Level (0-2 years)**: Learn basic networking, Linux, and one cloud platform (e.g., AWS). Obtain certifications like AWS Cloud Practitioner.
2. **Mid Level (2-5 years)**: Gain experience in infrastructure as code, automation, and monitoring. Pursue roles like Junior Cloud Engineer.
3. **Senior Level (5+ years)**: Lead infrastructure projects, optimize costs, and implement advanced security. Aim for Cloud Architect or SRE positions.
4. **Advanced**: Specialize in areas like multi-cloud, AI/ML infrastructure, or enterprise solutions. Consider leadership roles.

## Example Projects
- Deploy a web application on AWS using EC2, S3, and RDS
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster with monitoring using Prometheus
- Automate infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
