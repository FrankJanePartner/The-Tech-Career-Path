# Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

## Overview
Site Reliability Engineering combines software engineering and systems administration to build and maintain large-scale, highly reliable systems. SRE professionals focus on automating operations, improving system reliability, and ensuring services meet performance targets. This role emphasizes measuring and improving service level objectives (SLOs) while balancing innovation with operational stability.

## Common Roles
- Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
- DevOps Engineer
- Systems Reliability Engineer
- Platform Engineer
- Reliability Engineer
- Operations Engineer
- Incident Response Engineer

## Required Skills
- Programming and scripting (Python, Go, Bash)
- Cloud platforms and infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Monitoring and observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack)
- Containerization and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Incident management and postmortems
- Capacity planning and performance optimization
- Automation and CI/CD pipelines
- Service level agreements (SLAs) and objectives (SLOs)
- Chaos engineering and fault injection
