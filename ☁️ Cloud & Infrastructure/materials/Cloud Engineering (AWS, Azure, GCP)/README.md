# Cloud Engineering (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## Overview
Cloud Engineering focuses on designing, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure using major platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Professionals build scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud solutions that support applications and services. This role involves infrastructure as code, automation, and optimizing cloud resources for performance and reliability.

## Common Roles
- Cloud Engineer
- Cloud Architect
- DevOps Engineer
- Cloud Solutions Architect
- Infrastructure Engineer
- Cloud Security Engineer

## Required Skills
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) - core services and architecture
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM templates)
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Scripting and automation (Python, Bash, PowerShell)
- Networking in cloud environments
- Security best practices for cloud
- Monitoring and logging tools (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Stackdriver)
- Cost optimization and budgeting

## Career Roadmap
1. **Entry Level (0-2 years)**: Learn one cloud platform and basic services. Get certified (e.g., AWS Cloud Practitioner).
2. **Mid Level (2-5 years)**: Master multiple platforms, implement IaC, and work on complex deployments.
3. **Senior Level (5+ years)**: Design enterprise architectures, lead cloud migrations, and optimize large-scale systems.
4. **Advanced**: Become a cloud architect, consultant, or cloud CTO.

## Example Projects
- Deploy a web application on AWS using EC2 and S3
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster on GCP
- Automate infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Implement a serverless architecture on Azure Functions
- Design a multi-region disaster recovery solution
- Optimize cloud costs for a simulated business scenario
