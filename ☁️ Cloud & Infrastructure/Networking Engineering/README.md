# Networking Engineering

## Overview
Networking Engineering involves designing, implementing, and maintaining computer networks that connect devices and enable communication. Professionals work with hardware and software to ensure reliable, secure, and efficient data transmission across local and global networks. This field covers everything from small office networks to large-scale enterprise and cloud networking solutions.

## Common Roles
- Network Engineer
- Network Administrator
- Network Architect
- Systems Engineer
- Network Security Engineer
- Cloud Network Engineer
- Network Operations Center (NOC) Technician

## Required Skills
- Network protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP)
- Routing and switching (Cisco, Juniper, Huawei)
- Network security (firewalls, VPNs, intrusion detection)
- Wireless networking (Wi-Fi standards, cellular networks)
- Cloud networking (AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network, GCP VPC)
- Network monitoring and troubleshooting tools
- Scripting for network automation (Python, Ansible)
- Network design and architecture principles
- Certification knowledge (CCNA, CCNP, CompTIA Network+)
